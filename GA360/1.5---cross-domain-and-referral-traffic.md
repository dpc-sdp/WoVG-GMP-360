## 1.5.1 - Automatic self-referral detection
A self-referral is referral traffic that can originate from pages within your own domains. By default, Analytics will not identify traffic as referral, when:
* The referring website matched the **same domain** of the current page or any of its subdomains (e.g. your own website).
* The referring website is a result of a cross-domain measurement setup, e.g. when a user navigates across domains that you have configured in your **domains list** and the current page contains the linker parameter _gl.

## 1.5.1.1 - Step 1 - Configuring your domains for cross-domain measurement
* In Admin, navigate to one of the properties you want to include in cross-domain measurement
* In the Property column, click **Data Streams > Web**
* Click the data stream for your website, then under Additional Settings, click **More tagging settings**
* Click **Configure your domains**

## 1.5.1.2 - Step 2 - Configuring your domains for cross-domain measurement
* Under Include domains that match ANY of the following conditions:
  * Choose a match type.
  * Under Domain, enter the identifier for the domain you want to match (e.g., example.com).
* Click Add condition to add the next domain. (Add each domain you want to include in cross-domain measurement).
* Conditions are evaluated using OR logic.
* Click **Save**

_Note: Check the Analytics tag (e.g. the global site tag on each of your HTML pages) for each domain that you want to include in your cross-domain measurement.  The tag on each page must use the same Measurement ID (i.e same. "G-" ID) from the same web data stream._

## 1.5.2 - Adding unwanted referral traffic
A self-referral is referral traffic that can originate from pages within your own domains. By default, Analytics will not identify traffic as referral when the **referring website matched the same domain of the current page or any of itâ€™s subdomains.**
