# Before you start

## Configure Google Tag Manager (GTM)
Use Google Tag Manager to manage tags (such as measurement and marketing optimization JavaScript tags) on your site. Without editing your site code, you use the GTM user interface to add and update Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and non-Google tags. This reduces errors and allows you to deploy tags on your site quickly.
Google Tag Manager replaces all your measurement and marketing tags with a single, asynchronously loading tag—so your tags can fire faster without getting in each other’s way.

### Google Tag Manager Account Creation
If your agency or department doesn’t have a GTM account, follow [these instructions from Google](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en).

#### GTM Naming Convention
This is the WoVG naming convention for Google Tag Manager containers.

Please create your GTM Container under your Departmental GTM Account. If you are unsure how to access this account please reach out to the [DPC Analytics team](https://digital-engagement.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/group/16/create/69) or the team that manages your analytics.

Use your primary domain name, don’t include the www from the hostname.

For the Department of Premier and Cabinet, this would be:
- **dpc.vic.gov.au**
