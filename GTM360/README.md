# Set up and report performance measurement for the WoVG with Google Analytics and Tag Manager
Use these instructions to comply with the mandatory standard for the Victorian government for adding the Google Analytics tracking code to your website.

This process is **NOT** for Single Digital Presence sites.
## Configure Google Tag Manager (GTM)
Use Google Tag Manager to manage tags (such as measurement and marketing optimization JavaScript tags) on your site. Without editing your site code, you use the GTM user interface to add and update Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and non-Google tags. This reduces errors and allows you to deploy tags on your site quickly.
Google Tag Manager replaces all your measurement and marketing tags with a single, asynchronously loading tag—so your tags can fire faster without getting in each other’s way.
### Google Tag Manager Account Creation
If your agency or department doesn’t have a GTM account, follow [these instructions from Google](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en).
#### GTM Naming Convention
Please follow the WoVG naming convention for Google Tag Manager containers.
Use your primary domain name. Don’t include the www.

* dpc.vic.gov.au
#### GTM Installation
